#Twubric_project

Created with CodeSandbox

1. My project dispalys the card view of user's Twitter followers.
2. We have different Sort option to have a look for specific user.
3. Also we can view user's information for a particular duration using date range filter.
4. Button displayed in UI, has it's own specific purpose:
   [Filter]: Dispaly the data based on input provided.
   [RestFilter]: Clears the filter field selection.
   [Default value]: Removes all filter result, display default result.
